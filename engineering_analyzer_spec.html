ENGINEERING ANALYZER SPECIFICATION

Version: 0.1
Target: Single HTML file
Execution: Client-side only
Deterministic: Yes

1. Purpose

The Engineering Analyzer is a browser-based deterministic analysis engine that:

Accepts structured JSON input files

Executes selected analysis modules

Produces structured JSON and Markdown outputs

Provides visual inspection of inputs and results

Requires no server or API

2. Execution Environment

Single file: engineering_analyzer.html

All CSS inline

All JavaScript inline

No external dependencies required

Compatible with GitHub Pages hosting

Runs entirely in browser memory

3. File Locations (Project Structure)

Input source (repository reference):

C:\Repos\minipcb.github.io\json


Output target (repository reference):

C:\Repos\minipcb.github.io\analysis_results


Since the application runs in browser:

Files are loaded via file input control

Files are exported via Blob download

User manually places downloaded files into analysis_results

No filesystem write access is assumed.

4. Supported Input Files
Required

netlist.json (miniPCB schema v1.1)

Optional

test_plan.json

parts_library.json

tolerance_library.json

stress_rules.json

All inputs must validate against defined JSON schemas before analysis.

5. Core Architecture

The application defines a deterministic analyzer registry:

const analyzers = {
  fmea: runFMEA,
  epsa: runEPSA,
  wcca: runWCCA,
  coverage: runCoverage
};


Each analyzer:

Accepts structured input object

Produces deterministic output object

Produces no side effects

Uses no randomness

Uses no AI

Uses no asynchronous external calls

6. User Interface Specification

UI elements must appear in the following order:

Top Control Panel

[ Upload Files ]
[ Select Analysis Type ▼ ]
[ Run Analysis ]
[ Export Results ]

Main Content Area

Left Panel:

Input JSON Viewer (collapsible)

Net Graph Viewer (optional for v0.1)

Right Panel:

Analysis Results Table

Risk / Stress / Margin table

Summary statistics

Output JSON Viewer (collapsible)

Styling requirements:

Dark mode

Consistent with Test Base 2026 color scheme

Collapsible panels

Scrollable tables

Fixed-width JSON display

Deterministic layout

7. Analysis Modules

Each module must operate deterministically.

7.1 FMEA Module

Function: runFMEA(netlist, test_plan)

7.1.1 Failure Mode Assumptions

Failure assumptions are defined by component class:

Resistors:

open

short

oot_high

oot_low

Capacitors:

open

short

capacitance_low

esr_high

Transistors:

gain_low

be_short

ce_short

open_collector

Connectors:

open_contact

intermittent_contact

Test Points:

measurement_error

Failure assumption list must be static and version-controlled.

7.1.2 Propagation Rules

Propagation is rule-based.

Example deterministic rule:

If resistor fails oot_low:

Downstream node voltage increases

Upstream bias shifts

Propagation must:

Track affected nets

Track affected components

Track affected interface pins

No SPICE simulation is required.

7.1.3 RPN Calculation

RPN formula:

RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection

Severity:

Derived from affected net type

Interface nets > internal nets

Occurrence:

Derived from component type class

Detection:

Derived from coverage engine

If no test covers affected net, detection score worsens

All scoring tables must be explicitly defined constants.

7.1.4 FMEA Output

Produces:

fmea.json containing:

component

failure_mode

affected_nets

severity

occurrence

detection

RPN

coverage_status

Also produces:

fmea.md report

7.2 EPSA Module

Function: runEPSA(netlist, parts_library)

Required Data

Parts library must contain:

voltage_rating

current_rating

power_rating

temperature_rating

Deterministic Calculations

For each component:

Voltage stress:

Compare net nominal voltage to rating

Current stress:

If current metadata exists, compare to rating

Power dissipation:

For resistors: P = V^2 / R

Use deterministic approximations

Derating Margin:

Margin % = (Rating - Actual) / Rating × 100

Flag if below threshold.

EPSA Output

Produces:

epsa.json:

component

parameter

actual

rating

margin_percent

status

Also produces markdown report.

7.3 WCCA Module

Function: runWCCA(netlist, tolerance_library)

Deterministic Computation

Worst-case resistor network:

Rmax = R_nominal × (1 + tolerance)
Rmin = R_nominal × (1 - tolerance)

Propagate extremes through:

Voltage dividers

Gain stages

Bias networks

Calculate:

Worst-case output voltage

Worst-case gain

Worst-case bias current

Margin reporting:

Nominal vs worst-case difference

Percent deviation

WCCA Output

wcca.json:

network

nominal_value

worst_case_high

worst_case_low

deviation_percent

margin_status

7.4 Coverage Analysis Module

Function: runCoverage(netlist, test_plan)

Compute:

Net coverage %

= (# nets with test coverage) / (total nets)

Critical net coverage %

Critical nets defined as:

Interface nets

Power nets

Bias nets

Redundancy analysis:

Count test points per net

Flag single-point-of-failure nets

Produces:

coverage.json

8. Visualization Requirements

Minimum required for v0.1:

Sortable results table

Risk color scale

Coverage color scale

JSON viewer (input + output)

Download buttons

Optional (future):

Interactive net graph

Component failure highlight

9. Export Specification

Exports via Blob download:

Filename format:

analysis_<type><board_pn><revision>.json
analysis_<type><board_pn><revision>.md

User manually places files into:

C:\Repos\minipcb.github.io\analysis_results

10. Deterministic Constraints

The application SHALL:

Use no randomness

Use no AI

Use no server calls

Produce identical output for identical input

Use versioned failure assumption tables

Use versioned scoring tables

Log analysis version in output JSON

11. Versioning

Output JSON must include:

"analysis_engine_version": "0.1"
"analysis_type": "fmea"
"generated_on": ISO8601 timestamp

12. Expandability

The architecture must allow:

Addition of new analyzer functions

Addition of new failure modes

Addition of new stress rules

Addition of AI explanation layer (optional future)

Without breaking deterministic core.

13. Future Extensions (Not v0.1)

AI narrative explanation

Monte Carlo simulation mode

Margin heatmaps

Reliability growth modeling

Auto TestBASE integration

Final Statement

engineering_analyzer.html is defined as:

A deterministic, client-side, multi-domain engineering analysis engine capable of executing FMEA, EPSA, WCCA, and coverage analysis using structured JSON inputs and producing structured JSON outputs suitable for version control.
