Probe contact moves to wrong node or loses contact.
##### Propagation 1
Sampled signal is discontinuous or from unintended net.
##### Propagation 2
Root-cause localization propagates to false suspects.

### Component: TP9
#### Failure Mode: open_test_node
##### Failure Effect
Test access path is open or inaccessible.
##### Propagation 1
Required observability point is unavailable.
##### Propagation 2
Coverage gaps increase and detection score worsens for related failures.
