## Failure Effects
| Component | Failure Mode | Failure Effect | Propagation 1 | Propagation 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | open_contact | One or more interface contacts are open. | Signal or supply continuity is interrupted. | External-system observability/control degrades and appears intermittent/static. |
| P1 | intermittent_contact | Contact intermittently opens under vibration or handling. | Momentary dropouts appear on interface nets. | Transient faults propagate as sporadic resets, spikes, or communication loss. |
| P1 | high_contact_resistance | Deterministic failure assumption for connector mode 'high contact resistance'. | Primary propagation: directly connected nets and bias points shift based on topology. | Secondary propagation: downstream interfaces, margins, and detection paths are impacted. |

| U1 | pin_short_to_adjecent_pin_up | A pin is shorted to the physically adjacent higher-index pin, coupling two intendedly independent IC nodes. | The victim/source pins are electrically forced together, corrupting logic levels, bias points, or analog signal integrity at the package boundary. | Propagation extends into connected nets and downstream stages as contention, false switching, unstable bias, or overstress signatures that appear topology-consistent across both pin paths. |
| U1 | pin_short_to_adjecent_pin_down | A pin is shorted to the physically adjacent lower-index pin, creating unintended bidirectional interaction between neighboring IC functions. | Both adjacent pin functions lose independence; expected drive/sense behavior degrades due to cross-loading, level collapse, or parasitic injection. | Secondary effects propagate as multi-net functional corruption, intermittent misbehavior under dynamic conditions, and misleading observability because both affected channels fail in a coupled pattern. |
