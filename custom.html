    Custom Designs
   </h1>
<p>
    Have a specific circuit in mind? Want to translate a classroom schematic into a hands-on lab experience?
      We offer 1:1 collaboration with professors and instructors to create
    <strong>
     custom miniPCB™ designs
    </strong>
    tailored to your course content.
   </p>
<p>
    Whether you're teaching filters, analog-to-digital conversion, switching regulators, or embedded systems, we can help turn your educational objectives into compact, clearly labeled, testable PCBs your students can build, measure, and explore.
   </p>
<p>
    We welcome early-stage ideas and sketched concepts. You’ll receive design previews and can give input throughout the process.
   </p>
<p>
    If you're interested in working together, please
    <a href="mailto:nolan@minipcb.com">
     get in touch
    </a>
    with a brief description of your course and what kind of board you’d like to create. We’ll take it from there.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     Let’s design something that helps your students learn better—together.
