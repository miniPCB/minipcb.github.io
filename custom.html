    <h1>Custom Designs</h1>

    <p>
      Have a specific circuit in mind? Want to translate a classroom schematic into a hands-on lab experience?
      We offer 1:1 collaboration with professors and instructors to create <strong>custom miniPCB™ designs</strong> tailored to your course content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're teaching filters, analog-to-digital conversion, switching regulators, or embedded systems, we can help turn your educational objectives into compact, clearly labeled, testable PCBs your students can build, measure, and explore.
    </p>

    <p>
      We welcome early-stage ideas and sketched concepts. You’ll receive design previews and can give input throughout the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in working together, please <a href="mailto:nolan@minipcb.com">get in touch</a> with a brief description of your course and what kind of board you’d like to create. We’ll take it from there.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Let’s design something that helps your students learn better—together.</strong></p>
