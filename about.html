    <h1>About miniPCB™</h1>

    <p>
      miniPCB™ is a growing collection of small, purpose-built circuit boards created to support hands-on learning in electronics education. Each board is designed to make it easier for students to explore real-world circuits, test ideas, and develop confidence in their skills.

    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>
      My journey began in a university lab, where I saw firsthand how students struggled to connect theory with real circuits. Schematic diagrams on a projector couldn’t compete with the insight gained from probing a real, working board.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began designing small PCBs for common circuit types—amplifiers, filters, oscillators—hoping to bridge the gap between lecture and lab. The feedback from instructors was encouraging, and the boards quickly evolved into a full-fledged educational toolset.

    <h2>What Makes miniPCBs Unique</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Standardized layout and labeling across all designs</li>
      <li>Built-in test points to encourage measurement and exploration</li>
      <li>Compact 100 × 100 mm v-scored panels for easy distribution</li>
      <li>Support for both analog and digital curriculum topics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who It's For</h2>
    <p>
      miniPCBs are built with educators in mind. Whether you're teaching introductory electronics or advanced analog design, these boards are meant to complement your curriculum, reinforce key concepts, and spark hands-on curiosity in the classroom.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      I’m continuously adding new designs based on instructor feedback and evolving classroom needs. I also welcome collaborations for custom boards built specifically for your courses.
