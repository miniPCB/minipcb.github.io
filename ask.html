   <h2>
    Asking for Help
   </h2>
   <p>
    Are you an instructor, professor, or educator? I'd greatly appreciate your help evaluating these miniPCB™ boards in a real classroom or lab environment. I'm currently offering
    <strong>
     free miniPCB™ samples
    </strong>
    for academic use—completely free of charge, including shipping.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you're willing, please solder up a board or two, power them up, and put them through their paces. I’d love to hear how they perform in your hands. Even better—send back a few photos of the boards in action, whether on the bench or in the classroom.
   </p>
   <p>
    I feature educator feedback directly in each board’s datasheet—for example, see the contribution from
    <a href="https://ritchieschool.du.edu/about/people/goncalo-fernandes-pereira-martins" target="_blank">
     <strong>
      Professor Goncalo at the University of Denver
     </strong>
    </a>
    in the
    <a href="datasheets/04B-005.pdf" target="_blank">
     Common Emitter Amplifier datasheet
    </a>
    . 
    If you post about the boards on your department or personal website, I’d be glad to link to it from the corresponding miniPCB™ product page.
   </p>
   <p>
    To request your free samples, just
    <a href="mailto:nolan@minipcb.com">
     <strong>
      send me an email
     </strong>
    </a>
    with your name, university, mailing address, and a brief note about which boards you'd like to try.
