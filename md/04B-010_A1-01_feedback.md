|----|----------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | High     | Missing Data  | Partlist (Schematic)    | Missing values for capacitors C1, C2, C3, C4, and resistors R1, R2, R3, R4, R5. | Provide specific values for all components.                       | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Typographical | Manual Commentary       | Typo in "Typical **R’s 10–150 kΩ**" should be "Typical **R's 10–150 kΩ**". | Correct the typographical error.                                   | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency   | Netlist (Schematic)     | Inconsistent pin labeling for P1 (e.g., "GND (1)" vs. "V+ (2)").       | Standardize pin labeling format across the document.              | Medium     |
| 4  | Low      | Style         | Manual Commentary       | Inconsistent use of bold formatting in "Bias divider" section.         | Ensure consistent use of bold formatting for emphasis.            | Medium     |
| 5  | Medium   | Missing Data  | Pinout Description Table, P1 | Missing label for Pin 3.                                               | Add a label or note for Pin 3 if applicable.                      | High       |
| 6  | Medium   | Consistency   | Circuit Description     | "R2 pot" is mentioned but not clearly defined in the partlist.         | Clarify the role and value range of R2 as a potentiometer.        | High       |
| 7  | Low      | Typographical | Circuit Description     | "R’s" should be "Rs" for plural form consistency.                      | Correct to "Rs".                                                  | High       |
