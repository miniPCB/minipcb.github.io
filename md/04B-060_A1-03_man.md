## Circuit Description

**Collector load (R4) & output coupling (C5):**

- **R4 1–10 kΩ** sets gain/current; **C5 1–10 µF** with output load sets LF corner.
    

**Emitter network (R5 to GND, R8/R9 network, C6 input coupling):**

- Input is at the emitter; pick **R5 47–470 Ω** (transimpedance); **C6** sized for desired **fc** with source impedance.
    
- Trade-offs: lower R5 gives higher current-gain but lowers input impedance.
    

**Base bias (R1, R2 pot, R3) + AC-ground caps (C3, C4):**

- Fix the base DC and hold it at AC ground with **C3/C4 0.1–1 µF**.
    
- Divider current ≈ 10× base current; **R’s 10–200 kΩ** typical.
    

**Supply decoupling (C1/C2):** as usual.
