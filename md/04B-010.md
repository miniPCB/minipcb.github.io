## Quick topology notes (derived from the netlist)

- **Bias network:** R1 (V+ side) → R2 (pot ends at N$2/N$3, wiper to base) → R3 (GND side). TP2/TP3 bracket the pot ends; TP4 is the base node.
- **Input coupling:** P1.4 (TP1) → **C1** → base node (TP4). C1 blocks input DC from disturbing the base bias.
- **Emitter network:** Q1 emitter → **R4** to GND (sets emitter DC / negative feedback). TP7 reads emitter DC/AC.
- **Output coupling:** Emitter (TP7) → **C4** → P1.5 (TP8). **R5** provides an output return/load to GND on the post-C4 side.
- **Collector:** At **V+** (TP5), confirming this is an **emitter follower / common-collector** style output with AC coupling.

# Circuit Description

This miniPCB implements a single-stage **emitter follower** (common-collector) using **Q1 (2N3904)** to provide high input impedance, low output impedance, and near-unity voltage gain (minus one base–emitter junction). The **input is AC-coupled** to the base; the **output is AC-coupled** from the emitter to the load.

## Power Supply Conditioning

Capacitors **C2** and **C3** are connected from **V+ (TP5, P1-2)** to **GND (TP6, P1-1)** to provide bulk filtering and high-frequency decoupling of the supply rail. Use **TP5 (V+)** and **TP6 (GND)** to verify supply level and ground reference during measurements.

## Input Coupling and Biasing

The AC input arrives at **P1-4** and is **AC-coupled** through **C1** to the transistor base node, blocking any DC from the source while passing the signal to the base. Measure across the coupling capacitor using **TP1** (source side) and **TP4** (base side).

Base bias is set by a three-element divider (**R1**, **R2** trimpot, **R3**):

- Increasing **R1** and **R3** relative to **R2** narrows the adjustment range but makes it finer.
- Decreasing **R1** and **R3** relative to **R2** widens the range but makes it coarser.

Adjust **R2** to set **the base voltage** at **TP4**; this establishes **the emitter voltage** and **the quiescent emitter current** through **R4**.

## Emitter Network and Stability

**R4** connects **the emitter** to **GND**, setting **the quiescent emitter current** and providing local negative feedback for operating-point and thermal stability. Probe **TP7** to read **the emitter voltage** (pre-coupling, DC present) and to observe available headroom and signal swing.  
_(No emitter bypass capacitor is used—preserving low output impedance and unity-gain behavior across the band.)_

## Output Coupling and Reference

The buffered signal is taken from **the emitter** and **AC-coupled** via **C4** to the output node at **TP8 / P1-5**. **R5** ties the output node to **GND**, providing a defined DC reference when no external load is present. The low-frequency cutoff is set by **C4** in combination with **R5** and any external load connected to **P1-5**.

## Transistor Configuration and I/O

**Q1** operates in **common-collector (emitter follower)** configuration:

- **Collector** → **V+** (see **V+** net).
- **Base** ← AC-coupled via **C1** and DC-biased by **R1–R2–R3**.
- **Emitter** → drives the load through **C4**; **R4** sets DC current and **R5** defines the output’s DC reference.

The **P1** header provides convenient connections: **P1-1 (GND)**, **P1-2 (V+)**, **P1-4 (AC input)**, and **P1-5 (AC-coupled output)**, aligned with test points for straightforward probing and bring-up.

# Circuit Theory

Current flows from **V+** through **R1** into **R2**, where the current splits: part of the current leaving the wiper terminal and passing through the base to the emitter of the transistor and through **R4** to ground, and the other (larger) part leaving the other terminal where it flows through **R3** to ground.

Resistor **R4** does more than just complete the path to ground. It develops a voltage proportional to the emitter current, creating negative feedback. As the transistor conducts more strongly, the emitter voltage rises, which in turn reduces the effective base–emitter voltage. This stabilizing action prevents thermal runaway and keeps the amplifier biased in its intended active region, largely independent of the transistor’s individual gain characteristics.

DC voltage at the input is blocked from the transistor's base by capacitor **C1**.

DC voltage at the output is blocked from the output pin by capacitor **C4**.

# Circuit Analysis
(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Is capacitor **C1**, together with **R1–R2–R3** (and the source impedance), sized so the input high-pass cutoff meets requirements at the lowest intended frequency?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) What is the **R2** adjustment range for **the base voltage**, and the corresponding range for **the emitter voltage** and quiescent current through **R4**?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Does the base-bias divider current (**through R1–R3**) exceed **10×** the expected base current at quiescent, so the base voltage is stiff across **β** variation?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Are the **voltage ratings and polarities** of **C1** and **C4** correct for all operating conditions (start-up, fault, temperature)?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Is the **output high-pass corner** set by **C4** and **R5 ∥ R_load** low enough for the application?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Is the **input impedance** at midband (bias network ∥ reflected emitter impedance) high enough for the source?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Is the **output impedance** (≈ small-signal emitter resistance ∥ R4) low enough for the intended loads?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Quiescent **emitter current**: IE≈(Vbase−0.65 V)/R4I_E \approx (V_\text{base}-0.65\text{ V})/R4IE​≈(Vbase​−0.65 V)/R4. Is this within design goals for headroom, noise, and output drive?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Power dissipation** in **Q1** at quiescent and worst case (signal + load). Is the thermal margin adequate?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Power dissipation** in **R4** and **R5** vs. their wattage ratings.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Headroom**: maximum undistorted swing at the emitter given **V+**, **the emitter voltage**, and **V_CE(sat)** margin.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Low-frequency tilt/transient** behavior due to **C1** and **C4** time constants with the driving source and load.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **High-frequency bandwidth** limits from transistor fTf_TfT​, wiring capacitances, and the bias network impedance at the base.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Sensitivity to **β (h_FE) variation**: does the design remain within spec for low-β devices?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Temperature drift**: impact of ΔVBE\Delta V_{BE}ΔVBE​ (≈ −2 mV/°C) and resistor tolerances on **the emitter voltage** and gain.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Noise contributors** (bias network resistors, source impedance) vs. required SNR; consider reducing **R1–R3** if noise is critical.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **PSRR** at the emitter: are **C2/C3** values and placement sufficient to keep supply ripple below the requirement at **TP7/TP8**?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Risk of **base overdrive or clipping** at maximum input level (ensure Vbase,pk−Vemitter,DC≲0.9 VV_\text{base,pk} - V_\text{emitter,DC} \lesssim 0.9\text{ V}Vbase,pk​−Vemitter,DC​≲0.9 V).

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Start-up behavior**: does the output node (**post-C4**) settle to ~0 V without objectionable pops when connected to the next stage?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Protection limits** for miswiring (e.g., shorted output, DC on input); are current limits and component ratings adequate?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Whether **test points** (**TP1, TP4, TP7, TP8, TP5, TP6**) map cleanly to analysis nodes for verification and calibration procedures.

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) If the design must drive **low loads (≤10 kΩ)**, is **R4** low enough (or **I_E** high enough) to maintain bandwidth and low distortion?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) Need for an **emitter bypass** (not used here): would partial bypassing of **R4** improve HF performance without sacrificing DC stability?

(Double-check | Analyze | Determine) **Worst-case tolerance stack-up** (capacitors ±20%, resistors ±1–5%, V+ range) still meets all frequency and bias targets.

**Notes**

- Keep the bench supply current-limited (e.g., **20–50 mA**) during all dynamics.
- If the source has **50 Ω** output, either use **Hi-Z** mode or double the set amplitude to achieve the intended **TP1** level.
- Targets assume **R1 = R3 ≈ 100 kΩ**, **R4 ≈ 1 kΩ**, **R5 ≈ 100 kΩ**, **C1 = 1 µF**, **C4 = 10 µF**. Adjust limits if your BOM differs.

---
# Calibration Instructions

1. Power on with no input. Adjust **R2** until **TP7 (emitter)** is **approximately one half of V+** (e.g., ~6 V on a 12 V rail).
2. Verify **TP4 (base) − TP7 (emitter)** is **about 0.6 to 0.7 V**; touch up **R2** if needed.
3. Connect the intended load and apply a small AC signal. If the output sags or low-frequency response is weak (especially with **Rload ≤ 10 kΩ**), **reduce R4** (to increase quiescent current and lower output impedance) and/or **increase C4**.

**Notes:** For high source impedance, increase **C1**. If polarized capacitors are used, orient **C1** “+” toward the base node and **C4** “+” toward the emitter node.

## Findings

- All resistors dissipate **≪ 0.25 W**; worst case is **R4 at ~36 mW (14%)**.
- **Q1** runs at **~6%** of package power rating, **15%** of VCE rating, and **3%** of current rating.
- Capacitors are well within voltage ratings; **C2** sits at **~48%** of a 25 V rating — acceptable, but a **35 V** part increases margin (especially for tolerance/temperature/line surges).

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All components operate within safe margins under the stated assumptions.**  
🔎 **Recommendation:** Upgrade **C2** to **35 V** (and optionally C1/C4 if you expect line spikes) for improved derating headroom.

## 1) Pass/Fail Criteria

- **DC (no signal):**
    - **TP7 (VE):** within **2.5–6.5 V** @ V+ = 12 V (after single trim at room; no re-trim across corners)
    - **TP4–TP7 (VBE):** **0.55–0.75 V**
    - **Supply current:** **2–7 mA**
    - **TP8 (post-C4) DC:** **|V| ≤ 50 mV**
- **AC @ 1 kHz (small signal):**
    - **Midband gain (TP7/TP1):** **0.95–1.02 V/V** (target ≈ 1.0)
    - **Phase (TP7 vs TP1):** **0° ± 10°**
    - **fL:** **≤ 20 Hz** (≤ 50 Hz worst-case bound)
    - **fH:** **≥ 500 kHz**
    - **Max undistorted swing (10 kΩ load):** **≥ 8 Vpp** at TP8

---

## 2) Worst-Case Assumptions (conservative)

- **Supply:** 12 V ±10% (10.8–13.2 V)
    
- **Ambient:** −40 °C to +85 °C (no re-trim across corners)
    
- **Resistors:** ±1%
    
- **Electrolytic caps:** −20/+80% C, **leakage worst-case**; ceramic/film ±10%
    
- **2N3904:** β = 60…300; **VBE(25 °C)** ≈ 0.65 V; **dVBE/dT ≈ −2 mV/°C**; **VCE(sat)** ≈ 0.2 V
    
- **Trim strategy:** **R2 set at room** so that nominal **VE ≈ 4.7–4.8 V** @ 12 V (realistic with 100 kΩ–50 kΩ–100 kΩ network and R4 = 1 kΩ)
    

---

## 3) DC Worst-Case Corners

_(Single trim at room; R2 fixed thereafter)_

Nominal trim used for analysis: **R2 wiper toward V+ end** (low R2-top), which yields the stiffest divider consistent with VE ≈ 4.7–4.8 V at 12 V, 25 °C, β ≈ 150.

- **Corner A — Cold/Weak/Low-V** (V+ = **10.8 V**, **VBE = 0.80 V**, **β = 60**)
    
    - **VB ≈ 3.64 V**, **VE ≈ 2.84 V**, **IE ≈ 2.84 mA** → **Pass** (within 2.5–6.5 V window)
        
- **Corner B — Nominal** (V+ = **12.0 V**, **VBE = 0.65 V**, **β = 150**)
    
    - **VB ≈ 5.33 V**, **VE ≈ 4.68 V**, **IE ≈ 4.68 mA** → **Pass**
        
- **Corner C — Hot/Strong/High-V** (V+ = **13.2 V**, **VBE = 0.55 V**, **β = 300**)
    
    - **VB ≈ 6.69 V**, **VE ≈ 6.14 V**, **IE ≈ 6.14 mA** → **Pass**
        

**Divider loading sanity:** With R1/R3 = 100 kΩ and a 50 kΩ trimmer, bias stiffness relies on moving the wiper toward one end. The chosen trim provides adequate divider current so base loading across β keeps VE within the 2.5–6.5 V band **without re-trim**.

---

## 4) AC Worst-Case

- **Midband gain (TP7/TP1):** Emitter follower → **~1 V/V**. Across C1/C4 tolerances and β spread, **0.95–1.02 V/V** holds at 1 kHz. → **Pass**
    
- **Low-frequency corner (fL):**
    
    - **Input HPF:** fL,in≈12πC1(Rsource+Rin)f_{L,\text{in}} \approx \frac{1}{2\pi C_1 (R_\text{source}+R_\text{in})}fL,in​≈2πC1​(Rsource​+Rin​)1​. With **C1 = 2.2 µF**, RinR_\text{in}Rin​ ≥ 50 kΩ → **≪ 20 Hz** even at −20% C.
        
    - **Output HPF:** fL,out≈12πC4(R5∥Rload)f_{L,\text{out}} \approx \frac{1}{2\pi C_4 (R_5 \parallel R_\text{load})}fL,out​≈2πC4​(R5​∥Rload​)1​. With **C4 = 2.2 µF**, **R5 = 100 kΩ**, **R_load ≥ 10 kΩ** → **≤ 7–10 Hz** at −20% C. → **Pass**
        
- **High-frequency corner (fH):** Set by device fTf_TfT​, wiring C, and base network impedance; **≥ 500 kHz** is conservative. → **Pass**
    
- **Max swing:** Limited by headroom to rails: at worst corner (VE ≈ 2.84 V @ 10.8 V), lower headroom ≈ 2.84 V, upper headroom ≈ 10.8−2.84−0.2 ≈ 7.8 V → **≥ 5.6 Vpp** at emitter; best corner allows **> 12 Vpp**. With AC coupling, **≥ 8 Vpp** to a 10 kΩ load is **achievable**. → **Pass**
    

---

## 5) Part-Level Worst-Case Stress (tie-in to EPSA)

- **Q1 (2N3904):**  
    IC≤6.1I_C \le 6.1IC​≤6.1 mA, VCE≈V+−VE≈6V_{CE} \approx V^+ - V_E \approx 6VCE​≈V+−VE​≈6 V → PD≲37P_D \lesssim 37PD​≲37 mW **≪ 625 mW** → **Pass**
    
- **R4 (1 kΩ):** P≈VE2/R4≤6.142/1k≈38P \approx V_E^2/R_4 \le 6.14^2/1\text{k} \approx 38P≈VE2​/R4​≤6.142/1k≈38 mW **≪ 0.25 W** → **Pass**
    
- **C1, C4 (2.2 µF):** DC bias ~ **6–6.6 V** on 25 V parts → **< 30%** of rating; leakage worst-case does not upset DC trims. → **Pass**
    

---

## 6) Sensitivities (ranked)

1. **β spread** → shifts bias via base current loading of the divider (primary driver of VE drift).
    
2. **C1, C4 tolerance/leakage** → shapes fL and start-up settling at TP8.
    
3. **Supply tolerance** → small VE drift; large headroom remains.
    
4. **Wiper position (R2)** → sets both VE and divider stiffness (R_TH).
    

---

## 7) Bench Verification (corner checks)

- After trimming at room, sweep **V+ = 10.8 → 13.2 V** and temperature (if available); confirm **TP7 in 2.5–6.5 V**, **TP4−TP7 = 0.55–0.75 V**, and **I_SUP = 2–7 mA**.
    
- Inject **1 kHz, 100 mVpp**: verify **0.95–1.02 V/V** at **TP7**, **fL ≤ 20 Hz**, **fH ≥ 500 kHz**, and **≥ 8 Vpp** unclipped into **10 kΩ** at **TP8**.
    

---
## 8) Conclusions & Actions

- **WCCA Result:** ✅ Meets DC/AC criteria across conservative corners **without re-trim**.
    
- **Recommendations:**
    
    1. During trim, bias **wiper toward the V+ end** to stiffen the divider (reduces base-loading sensitivity).
        
    2. If very tight VE tolerance is required across β and temperature, **reduce R1/R3 values** (e.g., 47 kΩ each) or specify a β floor for Q1.
        
    3. Keep **C1/C4** at **25 V** class to maintain ample derating and low leakage variation.

**Notes & usage in analysis**

- Thresholds above define how each injected fault is modeled during FMEA.
- “**Short**” = unintended low-resistance path (**≤ 10 Ω**) unless a stricter criterion is specified in a given test.
- “**Open**” = loss of conduction (**≥ 1 MΩ**) or **|Z|** ≫ nominal at the relevant frequency.
- “**Out of tolerance (OOT)**” = parameter(s) outside **procured part** datasheet tolerance or stability limits; for electrolytics, ESR/leakage excursions are included.
- Reverse polarity of polarized capacitors is treated as an **OOT precursor** that often progresses to **short**; evaluate both states when relevant.

## Notes on Effects & “No-Single-Fault” Compliance

- **Output DC safety:** Any single short that could place DC on the output (e.g., **C4 short**) is **caught by Static-7/8** before dynamic tests; acceptance criterion (**±50 mV**) prevents unsafe downstream bias.
- **Over-current:** **C2/C3 shorts** are contained by bench supply current limit; **R4 short** still keeps current **< 50 mA** at 12 V with R4 present, satisfying the rule.
- **Thermal:** Highest steady dissipation is **Q1 ≈ 36–40 mW** and **R4 ≈ 36–40 mW** → far below limits (EPSA). No single fault pushes these beyond ratings with the current limit in place.

## Recommended Design / Process Controls

1. **Polarity protection:** Add **reverse-polarity diode** or series PTC on P1-2 (V+).
2. **Test-point safety:** Increase TP spacing, add **solder mask dams**/guard rings; provide **looped TPs** for clip leads.
3. **Pot reliability:** Use trimmer with **wiper-to-end** internal tie; apply conformal coat or seal after calibration.
4. **Cap derating:** Prefer **35 V** electrolytics for C1/C2/C4 to improve lifetime; choose low-leakage grade for C4.
5. **Assembly QA:** AOI for polarity/orientation; flux cleaning per **IPC-J-STD-001**; add in-circuit continuity checks aligned to **STTO**.
6. **Documentation:** Keep the **STTO / Static / Dynamic** tables with the board for bring-up to maintain detection coverage.
