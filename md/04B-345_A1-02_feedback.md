| #  | Severity | Category     | Location                  | Finding                                                                 | Suggested Fix                                                      | Confidence |
|----|----------|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | High     | Component    | Partlist (Schematic)      | Missing values/descriptions for all components.                        | Add specific values/descriptions for each component.              | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Typo         | Manual Commentary         | "Miller/HF caps" might be unclear.                                     | Clarify as "Miller or high-frequency capacitors".                  | Medium     |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency  | Schematic Export          | "Pieces per Panel" is listed as 2, but no context is provided.         | Provide context or remove if not relevant.                        | Medium     |
| 4  | Low      | Formatting   | Schematic Export          | Inconsistent use of units (e.g., "µF" vs "kΩ").                        | Ensure consistent unit formatting throughout the document.         | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Allowed List | Netlist (Schematic)       | No issues with refdes or nets outside the allowed lists.               | N/A                                                               | High       |
| 6  | Medium   | Clarity      | Circuit Description       | "Set each stage Ic 0.5–2 mA" lacks context for Ic.                     | Specify "collector current (Ic)".                                  | High       |
| 7  | Medium   | Clarity      | Circuit Description       | "Use bleeders 100 kΩ" is vague.                                        | Specify the purpose of bleeders more clearly.                      | Medium     |
