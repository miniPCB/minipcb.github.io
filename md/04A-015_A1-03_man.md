## Circuit Description

**Diff-arm resistors (R4/R5 inputs, R6/R7 trims, R8 feedback):**

- Choose matched ratios for good CMRR: **(R8/R4) = (R? /R5)** per your topology.
    
- Typical absolute values: **4.99–49.9 kΩ** metal-film 0.1% pairs; start around **10 kΩ** for noise/drive balance.
    
- Trade-offs: higher values save current but raise noise and input bias error; tighter tolerance improves CMRR.
    

**Reference & output lift (R1–R3, R9–R12, C2/C4/C6):**

- Pot **R2 10–100 kΩ** creates **REF**; filter it with **C2/C4 0.47–4.7 µF**.
    
- **R12** feeds **VREF/OUTREF**; pick **10–100 kΩ** to bleed noise without loading.
    
- If you want OUT centered at mid-supply, set REF ≈ V+/2.
    

**Compensation (C5 across VFB/OUT):**

- Start **10–33 pF** (larger if the source is high-Z or cable-driven).
    

**Supplies/decoupling (C1, C3 bulk; C6 ref cap):** as before.

**Op-amp:** common-mode range must include REF and input swing; choose **RRIO** with **GBP** consistent with your differential bandwidth.
