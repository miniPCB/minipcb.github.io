## Circuit Description

**Decoupling (C1–C4):**

- Typical: per rail, **0.1 µF X7R** at each op-amp supply pin + **4.7–10 µF** bulk nearby.
    
- Range: 10 nF–1 µF (ceramic) + 1–47 µF (bulk).
    
- Trade-offs: bigger bulk improves transient load rejection but increases inrush; 0.1 µF keeps HF impedance low.
    

**Input/output nodes (no R/C shown):**

- Add optional **Rout 22–100 Ω** for cable drive/isolation; optional **Cin (AC-coupling) 1–10 µF** with **Rin to GND 100 kΩ** to set a sub-Hz corner if needed.
    
- Trade-offs: Rout improves stability with capacitive loads but adds output drop; AC coupling sets low-frequency roll-off (fc).
    

**Op-amp U1:**

- Choose a unity-gain-stable device with GBP ≥ max signal bandwidth × 10. For audio/DC work: **GBP 5–20 MHz**, **SR ≥ 2×(2π fmax Vpk)**, **rail-to-rail in/out** if single-supply.
    
- Trade-offs: lower noise op-amps often need more current; CMOS inputs minimize Ib-_R_ error on high-impedance sources.
    

**Connector P1:** pinout exposes dual channels in/out and supplies for easy bring-up (GND, V±, IN.A/B, OUT.A/B).
