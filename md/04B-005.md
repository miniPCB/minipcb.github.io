# Circuit Description

This miniPCB implements a single-stage common emitter amplifier designed around a discrete NPN bipolar junction transistor (Q1), with optional substitution for an N-channel JFET or MOSFET. The amplifier may be used to demonstrate voltage gain, phase inversion, and the effects of feedback and biasing techniques.

## Power Supply Conditioning
Capacitors **C1** and **C3** serve as power rail decoupling and filtering elements, suppressing high-frequency noise and stabilizing the DC supply voltage. Test points **TP3 (V+)** and **TP4 (GND)** are provided for measuring supply and ground reference levels.

## Input Coupling and Biasing
The AC input signal is capacitively coupled to the amplifier via **C2**, which blocks DC offset from the signal source, ensuring proper biasing of the transistor base.  

Test points **TP1** and **TP2** allow voltage measurements across this input coupling capacitor.  

Biasing of the transistor base is achieved through a resistor divider network consisting of **R1**, **R2**, and **R3**, with **R2** implemented as a multiturn potentiometer for fine adjustment of the base voltage and operating point. This sets the quiescent collector current and ensures linear amplifier operation in the active region. The larger R1 and R3 with respect to R2, the finer the adjustment and narrower the adjustment range. The smaller R1 and R3 with respect to R2, the coarser the adjustment and wider the adjustment range. 

Test points **TP5** and **TP6** monitor voltages at key nodes within this bias network.

## Feedback Network
A resistive-capacitive feedback loop composed of **R10** and **C5** connects the transistor's collector to its base. This provides frequency-dependent negative feedback that stabilizes gain, reduces distortion, and improves bandwidth.  

**TP11** allows direct access to a point within this feedback path for analysis. Jumper **J2** allows the feedback network to be removed from the circuit.

## Collector Network
The collector load consists of **R4**, **R7**, and **R8**, with **R7** as a multiturn potentiometer to adjust gain or output bias. These resistors determine the voltage drop between the power supply rail and the transistor collector, and directly affect the voltage gain.  

**TP9** and **TP10** are used to probe the collector and collector resistor network.

## Output Coupling and Biasing

The AC output is taken through the coupling capacitor **C6**, which blocks the collector’s DC level and centers the **output DC** near ground via **R11** (bleeder) and/or the external load.

- **TP10**: collector node (pre-coupling, DC present).
- **TP12**: output node (post-coupling, ~0 V DC).

Use **TP10** to set and verify the collector DC bias; use **TP12** for AC measurements.

## Emitter Network and Stability
The emitter is grounded through a multi-resistor network consisting of **R5**, **R6**, and **R9** (with **R9** being adjustable). These resistors set the emitter current and provide thermal stability through negative feedback.  

The AC bypass capacitor **C4** is placed in parallel with part of the emitter resistance to increase gain at higher frequencies by reducing AC degeneration.  

**TP7** and **TP8** enable measurement of the emitter voltage and overall emitter network behavior. **J1** inserts/removes the emitter degeneration network. Opening **J1** during powered tests is not recommended as it can upset bias.

## Transistor Configuration
**Q1** serves as the active amplifying device in the common emitter configuration. In the provided schematic, Q1 is a general-purpose NPN BJT. However, the board layout and biasing are designed to accommodate equivalent N-channel field-effect transistors (JFETs or MOSFETs) for experimentation with different semiconductor technologies.

# Circuit Theory

- **Topology:** Single-stage common-emitter amplifier using a bipolar junction transistor. The input signal is capacitively coupled to the base. The base is biased by a resistive divider with a trimmer to set the operating point. The collector uses a resistive load with an optional trimmer to tune gain/output headroom. The emitter uses degeneration for linearity and thermal stability; an emitter bypass capacitor increases midband gain by reducing AC feedback at higher frequencies. Optional collector-to-base feedback shapes response and reduces distortion. Output may be taken directly from the collector or, when present, through a coupling capacitor to block DC.

- **Biasing:** Choose the base voltage to be approximately one diode drop (about 0.6–0.7 V for silicon) above the emitter voltage. Set the divider current at least ten times the expected base current to stabilize the operating point against transistor gain variation.

- **Gain & bandwidth:** Midband magnitude of voltage gain is approximately the collector resistance seen by the small-signal model divided by the effective emitter resistance that is **not** bypassed. The low-frequency cutoff is set by the coupling and bypass capacitors with their respective resistances; the high-frequency cutoff is limited by device capacitances and any intentional feedback capacitor.

| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |

| 10  | Input not tied to Output  | DMM resistance between Input and Output (Ω) | 10 kΩ       | NA     | NA          |
**Notes**
- The **Input–Output ≥ 10 kΩ** guard catches accidental shorts through solder bridges or wrong footprints, while allowing legitimate high-value biasing paths inside the circuit.  
- If your specific design uses unusually low bias values, you can lower the thresholds accordingly (keep the “NC” checks at ≥ 1 MΩ).

| 1   | Supply current check          | Apply 9 V to V+; measure supply current           | 1 mA        | 2–3 mA    | 10 mA       |
| 2   | Measure the emitter voltage   | DC at emitter (TP7), referenced to ground         | 0.3 V       | 0.4–0.6 V | 0.8 V       |
| 3   | Measure the base voltage      | DC at base (TP5), referenced to ground            | 0.7 V       | 0.9–1.0 V | 1.2 V       |
| 4   | Measure the collector voltage | DC at collector (TP10), referenced to ground      | 2 V         | 3–6 V     | 7 V         |
| 5   | Measure the output DC level   | DC at output (TP12/post-C6), referenced to ground | –0.2 V      | ≈ 0 V     | +0.2 V      |
### Why these values?

- **Supply current:** a few mA is typical; too low suggests an open; too high suggests a short/misbias.
- **Emitter and base voltages:** the base should be roughly one diode drop (~0.6–0.7 V) above the emitter for a silicon BJT.
- **Collector voltage:** targeted near mid-supply to maximize symmetrical swing.
- **Output DC:** ~0 V because the output is AC-coupled through **C6** and bled by **R11**.

**Notes**

- Use a **100 kΩ load** on the Output unless your board specifies otherwise.
- Keep the **DC bias** from your Static Tests (VC ~ mid-supply) before running AC checks.
- If your build uses different bias values or loading, tweak the limits accordingly (keep the structure the same).

# Calibration Instructions

The common emitter amplifier includes adjustable resistors (**R2** and **R7**) that allow fine-tuning of the DC operating point and small-signal gain. Follow these steps after assembly and static tests:

1. **Initial Setup**  
   - Connect **V+** to a regulated **9 V supply**.  
   - Short the **Input** pin to **GND** through a 0.1 µF capacitor.  
   - Connect the **Output** pin to an oscilloscope (AC-coupled).  
   - Place jumpers **J1** and **J2** in their default “enabled” positions.
   - Set all trimmers approximately mid range.

2. **Bias Calibration (Set Quiescent Point)**  
   - Measure the **collector voltage** at TP10.
   - Adjust **R2** until the **collector voltage** is near **half the supply voltage** (≈ 4–5 V).  

3. **Gain Calibration**  
   - Apply a **50 mVpp, 1 kHz sinewave** to the Input.  
   - Observe the Output amplitude.  
   - Adjust **R7** (collector load/gain trimmer) until midband gain is about **Av = –4 V/V** (Target from Dynamic Tests).  

4. **Feedback Verification (Optional)**  
   - With **J2 installed**, verify that gain is reduced slightly and distortion is minimized.  
   - Remove **J2** to compare the open-loop gain vs. closed-loop response.  

5. **Final Checks**  
   - Re-run Static Tests: confirm the emitter voltage, the base voltage, and the collector voltage are within limits.
   - Re-run Dynamic Test #1 (Midband Gain). Confirm **3.0 ≤ |Av| ≤ 5.0**.  
   - Document the calibrated values in the test report.

**Notes**  
- Always re-check supply current after adjustments to ensure no over-biasing.  
- If using a JFET or MOSFET substitution for Q1, expected bias voltages will differ—adjust R2 accordingly to place the output near mid-supply.
