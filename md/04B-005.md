# Circuit Description

This miniPCB implements a single-stage common emitter amplifier designed around a discrete NPN bipolar junction transistor (Q1), with optional substitution for an N-channel JFET or MOSFET. The amplifier may be used to demonstrate voltage gain, phase inversion, and the effects of feedback and biasing techniques.

## Power Supply Conditioning

Capacitors **C2** (bulk filter) and **C3** (high-frequency decoupling) stabilize the supply rail by reducing ripple and shunting fast transients to ground. Test points **TP5 (V+)** and **TP6 (GND)** are provided to verify the supply voltage and establish a clean ground reference during measurements.

## Input Coupling and Biasing

The AC input is capacitively coupled through **C1**, which blocks any source DC and passes only the signal to the transistor base node.  
Use **TP1** (source side of C1) and **TP4** (base side of C1) to observe the voltage across the input coupling capacitor.

Biasing for the transistor base is set by the divider **R1–R2–R3**, with **R2** as an adjustable trimmer. Adjusting **R2** sets the base voltage and thus the quiescent emitter voltage and current. Larger **R1** and **R3** relative to **R2** provide finer adjustment over a narrower range; smaller **R1** and **R3** relative to **R2** provide coarser adjustment over a wider range.  
Monitor key bias nodes at **TP2** (upper divider node), **TP3** (lower divider node), and **TP4** (base node/wiper).

## Emitter Network and Stability

**R4** is the emitter bias resistor. It establishes the quiescent emitter current and provides local negative feedback that stabilizes operating point and temperature behavior. Measure the emitter DC level and signal swing at **TP7**.  
No emitter bypass capacitor is used in this design, preserving low output impedance and unity voltage gain behavior across the band.

## Output Coupling and Reference

The buffered signal is taken from the emitter and **AC-coupled** to the output via **C4**, which removes the emitter’s DC bias before the signal reaches external circuitry. **R5** provides a defined DC reference for the output node and, together with **C4** and any external load, sets the low-frequency cutoff.

- **TP7**: emitter node (pre-coupling, DC present).
    
- **TP8**: output node (post-coupling, ~0 V DC).
    

Use **TP7** to verify the emitter DC bias and available headroom; use **TP8** for AC-only measurements into the load.

## Transistor Configuration and I/O

**Q1** is an NPN BJT configured as a common-collector (emitter follower). Its collector is tied to the positive rail, the base is driven through **C1** and biased by **R1–R2–R3**, and the emitter drives the load through **C4**. The stage provides high input impedance, low output impedance, and approximately unity voltage gain (offset by the base–emitter junction drop).

The **P1** header brings out the supply pins (V+ and ground), the AC input (to **C1**), and the AC-coupled output (from **C4**). This facilitates easy connection to upstream sources and downstream loads while keeping probing straightforward via **TP1–TP8**.

# Circuit Theory

- **Topology:** Single-stage common-emitter amplifier using a bipolar junction transistor. The input signal is capacitively coupled to the base. The base is biased by a resistive divider with a trimmer to set the operating point. The collector uses a resistive load with an optional trimmer to tune gain/output headroom. The emitter uses degeneration for linearity and thermal stability; an emitter bypass capacitor increases midband gain by reducing AC feedback at higher frequencies. Optional collector-to-base feedback shapes response and reduces distortion. Output may be taken directly from the collector or, when present, through a coupling capacitor to block DC.

- **Biasing:** Size the divider so its current is at least ten times the expected base current, which helps stabilize the operating point against variations in transistor gain. Then adjust the base voltage so that the collector voltage settles near half the supply voltage.

- **Gain & bandwidth:** Midband magnitude of voltage gain is approximately the collector resistance seen by the small-signal model divided by the effective emitter resistance that is **not** bypassed. The low-frequency cutoff is set by the coupling and bypass capacitors with their respective resistances; the high-frequency cutoff is limited by device capacitances and any intentional feedback capacitor.

| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |

| 10  | Input not tied to Output  | DMM resistance between Input and Output (Ω) | 10 kΩ       | NA     | NA          |
**Notes**
- The **Input–Output ≥ 10 kΩ** guard catches accidental shorts through solder bridges or wrong footprints, while allowing legitimate high-value biasing paths inside the circuit.  
- If your specific design uses unusually low bias values, you can lower the thresholds accordingly (keep the “NC” checks at ≥ 1 MΩ).

| 1   | Supply current check          | Apply 9 V to V+; measure supply current           | 1 mA        | 2–3 mA    | 10 mA       |
| 2   | Measure the emitter voltage   | DC at emitter (TP7), referenced to ground         | 0.3 V       | 0.4–0.6 V | 0.8 V       |
| 3   | Measure the base voltage      | DC at base (TP5), referenced to ground            | 0.7 V       | 0.9–1.0 V | 1.2 V       |
| 4   | Measure the collector voltage | DC at collector (TP10), referenced to ground      | 2 V         | 3–6 V     | 7 V         |
| 5   | Measure the output DC level   | DC at output (TP12/post-C6), referenced to ground | –0.2 V      | ≈ 0 V     | +0.2 V      |
### Why these values?

- **Supply current:** a few mA is typical; too low suggests an open; too high suggests a short/misbias.
- **Emitter and base voltages:** the base should be roughly one diode drop (~0.6–0.7 V) above the emitter for a silicon BJT.
- **Collector voltage:** targeted near mid-supply to maximize symmetrical swing.
- **Output DC:** ~0 V because the output is AC-coupled through **C6** and bled by **R11**.

**Notes**

- Use a **100 kΩ load** on the Output unless your board specifies otherwise.
- Keep the **DC bias** from your Static Tests (VC ~ mid-supply) before running AC checks.
- If your build uses different bias values or loading, tweak the limits accordingly (keep the structure the same).

# Calibration Instructions

The common emitter amplifier includes adjustable resistors (**R2** and **R7**) that allow fine-tuning of the DC operating point and small-signal gain. Follow these steps after assembly and static tests:

1. **Initial Setup**  
   - Connect **V+** to a regulated **9 V supply**.  
   - Short the **Input** pin to **GND** through a 0.1 µF capacitor.  
   - Connect the **Output** pin to an oscilloscope (AC-coupled).  
   - Place jumpers **J1** and **J2** in their default “enabled” positions.
   - Set all trimmers approximately mid range.

2. **Bias Calibration (Set Quiescent Point)**  
   - Measure the **collector voltage** at TP10.
   - Adjust **R2** until the **collector voltage** is near **half the supply voltage** (≈ 4–5 V).  

3. **Gain Calibration**  
   - Apply a **50 mVpp, 1 kHz sinewave** to the Input.  
   - Observe the Output amplitude.  
   - Adjust **R7** (collector load/gain trimmer) until midband gain is about **Av = –4 V/V** (Target from Dynamic Tests).  

4. **Feedback Verification (Optional)**  
   - With **J2 installed**, verify that gain is reduced slightly and distortion is minimized.  
   - Remove **J2** to compare the open-loop gain vs. closed-loop response.  

5. **Final Checks**  
   - Re-run Static Tests: confirm the emitter voltage, the base voltage, and the collector voltage are within limits.
   - Re-run Dynamic Test #1 (Midband Gain). Confirm **3.0 ≤ |Av| ≤ 5.0**.  
   - Document the calibrated values in the test report.

**Notes**  
- Always re-check supply current after adjustments to ensure no over-biasing.  
- If using a JFET or MOSFET substitution for Q1, expected bias voltages will differ—adjust R2 accordingly to place the output near mid-supply.

# Appendix C — Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA)

## 1) Pass/Fail criteria (same as your plan)

- **DC:** VC ≈ mid-supply (3–6 V @ 9 V), VE ≈ 0.4–0.6 V, VB ≈ 0.9–1.0 V, ISUP ~2–3 mA.
    
- **AC @ 1 kHz:** |Av| = 3–5 V/V (target ~4), ~180° phase, fL ≤ 100 Hz (≤200 Hz worst-case bound), fH ≥ 20 kHz, max undistorted swing ≥1 Vpp.
    

## 2) Worst-case assumptions (conservative but realistic)

- VCC: 9 V ±10% (8.1–9.9 V).
    
- Temp: –40 °C to +85 °C (WCCA style; tighten if lab-only).
    
- **Resistors:** ±1%.
    
- **Caps:** If electrolytic, use –20/+80%; ceramics/film ±10% unless you have tighter parts.
    
- **2N3904:** β = 60…300; V_BE(25 °C) ~0.65 V, dV_BE/dT ≈ –2 mV/°C; V_CE(sat) ~0.2 V.
    
- **Cap voltage ratings (editable):** C1=16 V*, C2=16 V*, C3=50 V, C4=16 V*, C5=50 V, C6=16 V* (stars = common defaults you can up-rev if needed).
    

## 3) DC worst-case corners (single trim at room; **no re-trim** across corners)

Assume you set **VB ≈ 1.0 V at 25 °C** so that **VC ≈ 4.5 V @ 9 V** (per your calibration).

Let **Re(dc) = 330 Ω (R5)**; collector resistance dominated by **R4=3.3 kΩ** (R7/R8 adjust gain/headroom but the nominal is close to 3.3 kΩ).

### Corner A — Cold/weak/low-V (VCC=8.1 V, V_BE≈0.80 V, β=60)

- IE ≈ (VB–V_BE)/Re = (1.00–0.80)/330 ≈ **0.61 mA**
    
- IC ≈ **0.61 mA**; VC ≈ 8.1 – 0.61 mA·3.3 k ≈ **6.1 V** (active region)
    
- Headroom to top rail: ~2.0 V; to saturation: ~5.9 V → **Pass**
    

### Corner B — Hot/strong/high-V (VCC=9.9 V, V_BE≈0.55 V, β=300)

- IE ≈ (1.00–0.55)/330 ≈ **1.36 mA**
    
- VC ≈ 9.9 – 1.36 mA·3.3 k ≈ **5.4 V** (active region)
    
- Headroom to top rail: ~4.5 V; to saturation: ~5.2 V → **Pass**
    

**Divider loading (stability vs β):**  
Worst IB ≈ IC/β ≈ 1.5 mA/60 ≈ 25 µA. With R1||R3 ≈ 5 kΩ (mid-pot), divider current ≥250 µA meets your **≥10×IB** rule; worst VB droop ≲ IB·R_TH ≈ 0.13 V → **small** and trimmed out initially.

**DC verdict:** VC stays well within 3–6 V window without re-trim; VE, VB remain near targets across corners.

## 4) AC worst-case

### Midband gain (|Av|)

For J1/J2 installed and at 1 kHz, C4 reduces AC degeneration → |Av| ≈ RC(ac) / Re(ac,unbyp). Spread drivers: β (gm), C4 tolerance, RC tolerance, and R10/C5 feedback.

- **Low-gain worst-case:** RC –1%, C4 –20% effective (higher Re(ac)), β low, feedback most effective → still near **3 V/V** bound.
    
- **High-gain worst-case:** RC +1%, C4 +80% (electrolytic high side), β high, less effective feedback → near **5 V/V** bound.
    

**Result:** Your spec window **3–5 V/V** is WCCA-robust with this BOM.

### Bandwidth

- **LF poles:**
    
    - **C2–Rin:** With β low and C2 –20%, f_L rises.
        
    - **C4 corner:** With C4 –20%, low-f gain is reduced and f_L rises.
        
    - **C6–(R_load||R11):** With 100 kΩ load and C6 –20% → f_L,out ≈ 1/(2π·1.76 µF·100 kΩ) ≈ **~0.9 Hz** (not limiting).
        
    - **Worst-case f_L:** set by **C2–Rin** or C4 corner; your acceptance **≤100 Hz (≤200 Hz bound)** is realistic.
        
- **HF poles:** Device C_μ with Miller, C_π, and C5 (feedback). Worst-case f_H when |Av| is high and β is high. Your lower bound **≥20 kHz** is conservative; typical ~**50 kHz** is expected around 1 mA bias.
    

### Output swing @1 kHz

With |Av|≈4 and 50 mVpp in → ~0.2 Vpp out; your **≥1 Vpp** undistorted swing spec clears both rail and saturation margins at corners → **Pass**.

### Input impedance

Worst with β low and more degeneration; your **≥50 kΩ** lower limit (test method with series-R injection) is **achievable**; divider Thevenin is only a few kΩ and emitter bootstrapping raises effective Rin.

## 5) Part-level worst-case stress (BOM-specific)

(Use your actual voltage ratings; placeholders below are common choices.)

### Semiconductor

- **Q1 (2N3904):**
    
    - V_CE ≤ ~6.1 V worst, **≪ 40 V rating** → **Pass**
        
    - I_C ≤ ~2 mA, **≪ 200 mA** → **Pass**
        
    - P_D ≈ I_C·V_CE ≲ ~12 mW worst → **≪ 625 mW** → **Pass**
        

### Resistors (all at 0.25 W typical unless you specified otherwise)

- Highest stress: **R4 (3.3 kΩ)** at ~1–1.5 mA → **P ≈ 3–8 mW**; others are lower. **All ≪ 250 mW** → **Pass**
    

### Capacitors (assumed ratings; edit if different)

- **C1 (4.7 µF, rail decoupling):** sees **~9.9 V max**; with a **16 V part**, derating ~62% of rating (a bit tight vs 50% guideline). **Recommend 25 V** if space/cost allow.
    
- **C2 (2.2 µF, input coupling):** ~1 Vpk typical → **16 V rating** is ample.
    
- **C3 (0.1 µF):** rail bypass; **50 V** very safe.
    
- **C4 (4.7 µF, emitter bypass):** ~0.5–1 V typical → **16 V** ample.
    
- **C5 (1 nF, feedback):** small-signal node; **50 V** ample.
    
- **C6 (2.2 µF, output coupling):** sees ~VC DC across C6’s **+** lead (≈4–6 V) → **16 V** ample.
    

**EPSA tie-in:** Only **C1@16 V** grazes the “≥2×Vuse” comfort rule; up-rate to **25 V** for clean derating.

## 6) Sensitivity summary (ranked)

1. **C4 tolerance** → primary spread on midband gain & f_L.
    
2. **β spread** → gm (gain) and Rin; divider ≥10×IB keeps VB stable.
    
3. **RC effective (R4/R7/R8)** → gain & VC headroom.
    
4. **C5 feedback** → gain linearization & HF extension.
    
5. **Supply tolerance** → modest VC shift; plenty of headroom remains.
    

## 7) Bench verification (worst-case quick checks)

- Trim **R2** at room for **VC ≈ 4.5 V @ 9 V**; set **R7** for **|Av| ≈ 4**.
    
- Sweep **VCC = 8.1 → 9.9 V** without re-trim: confirm **VC in 3–6 V**, VE/VB near targets, ISUP sane.
    
- AC: confirm **3 ≤ |Av| ≤ 5**, **f_L ≤ 200 Hz**, **f_H ≥ 20 kHz**, and **≥1 Vpp** unclipped at 1 kHz.
    

## 8) Conclusions & BOM-specific actions

- **Pass (WCCA):** With this BOM, the stage remains in the **active region** and meets **gain/bandwidth** targets across conservative worst-case spreads.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    1. **Upgrade C1 to 25 V** for cleaner derating.
        
    2. If you want **tighter gain tolerance**, choose a tighter-tolerance **C4** (or spec a low-leakage, audio-grade electrolytic) and/or lean a bit more on **R10/C5** feedback.
        
    3. Keep **divider current ≥10× IB** (your guideline) to neutralize β spread.
