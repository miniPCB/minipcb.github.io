## Circuit Description

**Bias string (D1, D2 + R1/R2):**

- Two small-signal diodes (e.g., 1N4148 or BAV99-like) set ~1.2–1.4 V to reduce crossover.
    
- **R1/R2 10–100 kΩ** provide bias currents; make the diode current **~0.5–2 mA** for thermal stability.
    
- Trade-offs: higher bias reduces crossover distortion but increases quiescent current/thermal drift.
    

**Output coupling (C4) & load (R3):**

- Choose **C4** to set LF corner with **Rload**; for **R3 10 kΩ**, **C4 4.7–10 µF** → fc ≈ 3–1.6 Hz.
    
- Add **snubber 10–100 Ω + 100–470 pF** across output if driving capacitive loads.
    

**Input coupling (C1):** sized to source/network; **2.2–10 µF** typical.

**Transistors Q1/Q2:** complementary small-signal pair; design for **IcQ 1–5 mA** depending on load needs.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04B-015_A1-01_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
