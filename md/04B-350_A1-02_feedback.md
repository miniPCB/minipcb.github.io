| 1   | High     | Consistency | Partlist (Schematic)         | Missing values/descriptions for all components.                   | Add values/descriptions for C1–C8, Q1–Q3, R1–R17, TP1–TP6.          | High       |
| 2   | Medium   | Consistency | Netlist (Schematic)          | Inconsistent pin labeling (e.g., "S", "E", "A").                  | Standardize pin labeling across the document.                       | Medium     |
| 3   | Medium   | Consistency | Manual Commentary            | No specific component values provided in the circuit description. | Include specific component values in the circuit description.       | Medium     |
| 4   | Low      | Typo        | Manual Commentary            | "CMS" instead of "CMOS" (if applicable).                          | Verify and correct to "CMOS" if intended.                           | Low        |
| 5   | Low      | Style       | Pinout Description Table, P1 | Missing notes for pins 1, 2, 4, and 5.                            | Add notes or indicate "N/A" if no additional information is needed. | Low        |
| 6   | Low      | Consistency | ULP Revision Date            | Future date "20250907" might be a typo.                           | Verify the date and correct if necessary.                           | Low        |
