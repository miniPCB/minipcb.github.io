## Circuit Description

**Bias divider (R1, R3 or R2 pot):**

- Set base at the desired quiescent emitter + ~0.7 V. Divider current ≈ **5–10×** base current.
    
- Typical **R’s 10–150 kΩ**; **R2 pot 10–100 kΩ**.
    

**Emitter/load (R4, R5):**

- **R4 (pre-cap) 220–2.2 kΩ** sets output bias/loading; **R5 (after C4) 1–10 kΩ** is the defined external load.
    
- Trade-offs: lower R lowers output impedance at the cost of quiescent current.
    

**Coupling caps:**

- **C1 in** and **C4 out** sized for **fc 5–20 Hz** with the seen resistances (often 2.2–10 µF).
    
- Supply decoupling **C2/C3 = 0.1 µF + 4.7 µF**.
    

**Transistor Q1:** general-purpose NPN (e.g., 2N3904/BC547) at **Ic 0.5–2 mA**.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04B-010_A1-01_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
