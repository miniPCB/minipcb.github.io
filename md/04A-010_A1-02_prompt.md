## Circuit Description

**Gain network (R8 feedback high, R9 feedback low):**

- **Av = 1 + R8/R9**.
    
- Typical: **R9 1–10 kΩ**, **R8 4.7–100 kΩ** (Av ~2–21+).
    
- Lowering both reduces noise and raises input bias current error through R9.
    

**Bias/reference (R1–R7, C1, C3, C5):**

- Pot R2 (10–100 kΩ) + R1/R3 forms BIAS; **C1/C3 0.1–1 µF** to quiet it; **C5 1–10 µF** for VREF_FILTERED.
    
- Trade-offs: more filtering reduces output “bounce” when input is disconnected; but large caps slow settling when you adjust the pot.
    

**AC shaping (C7 from OUT to VFB, R10 series in VFB path, R11/R12 output loading):**

- Start with **C7 10–33 pF** for HF peaking control.
    
- Optional **Rout (R11) 22–100 Ω** helps with capacitive loads.
    

**Input path (R6 series, optional RC to ground R7/C5):**

- **R6 100–1 kΩ** helps with ESD and op-amp input protection diodes during overdrive.
    

**Supplies:** same decoupling practice as above.

**Op-amp:** unity-gain stable, GBP ≥ (Av × fmax × 10), rail-to-rail if single supply.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04A-010_A1-02_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
