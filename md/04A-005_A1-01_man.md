## Circuit Description

**Gain network (R4 input, R5 feedback, R9 series/trim, R7 load):**

- Set gain: **Av = −R5/Rin**, where Rin is R4 (+ any series parts).
    
- Typical: **Rin 1–10 kΩ**, **R5 5–100 kΩ** (Av from −1 to −100).
    
- Lower values reduce Johnson noise and improve HF, but raise load on source and op-amp output.
    
- If you keep **R5 || Rload ≥ 2 kΩ**, many op-amps remain happy; add **Rout 22–51 Ω** if driving cables.
    

**Reference / bias (R1–R3, R6–R8, C1–C5):**

- Pot R2 (typically **10–100 kΩ**) builds a quiet mid-reference (VR/VREF+).
    
- Filter caps: **C1, C3, C4 = 100 nF–1 µF** local filters; **C2/C5 bulk 4.7–10 µF** to V+.
    
- Trade-offs: larger bias-node caps (1–10 µF) lower noise/offset drift on +IN, but slow start-up and recovery.
    

**AC shaping (C6 across VFB/OUT, C7 input coupling + J1):**

- **C7** with Rin sets input high-pass: pick **fc_in = 1–10 Hz** (e.g., Rin 10 kΩ + C7 1–10 µF).
    
- **C6** for stability/HF roll-off: start **10–47 pF** in parallel with **R5** (zero/pole with node impedances).
    
- Trade-offs: more C6 = better stability, lower noise peaking, but lower bandwidth.
    

**Supplies (C2, C5 bulk; C1, C3, C4 local):** values like 0.1 µF + 10 µF per rail as above.

**Op-amp U1:** GBP ≥ **|Av| × fmax × 10**; low Vos/Ib if you rely on a precision reference at +IN.
