| 1  | High     | Consistency| Netlist                   | Duplicate entry for GND at U1 +IN pin.                                  | Remove duplicate entry.                                                   | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Completeness| Partlist                  | Missing values/descriptions for C1, C2, C3, C4, D1, R1, R2.             | Add values/descriptions for these components.                             | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency| Manual Commentary         | Inconsistent description of Q1 as "PNP" without further details.        | Provide full part number or specifications for Q1.                        | Medium     |
| 4  | Low      | Typographical| Manual Commentary         | "CMS" should be "CMOS" in context of op-amp description.                | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS".                                                  | High       |
| 5  | Medium   | Completeness| Pinout Description Table  | Missing notes for P1 pins.                                              | Add notes or descriptions for each pin function.                          | Medium     |
| 6  | Low      | Style      | PCB Dimensions            | Inconsistent unit style (mm vs. millimeters).                           | Use consistent unit style throughout the document.                        | Medium     |
| 7  | Medium   | Consistency| Circuit Description       | No mention of U1 type or specifications.                                | Include U1 type and key specifications in the circuit description.        | Medium     |
| 8  | Low      | Consistency| Revision History          | Missing revision identifier for initial release.                        | Add a revision identifier (e.g., "A1-01") for the initial release.        | Medium     |
