|----|----------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | High     | Completeness | Partlist (Schematic)      | Missing values/descriptions for capacitors C1, C2, C3, C4.             | Add specific capacitance values and voltage ratings for C1, C2, C3, C4. | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Consistency | Manual Commentary         | "CMS" likely intended to be "CMOS" in op-amp description.              | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS".                                             | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency | Schematic Export          | Duplicate entries for nets N$1, N$2, N$3, N$4 in U1 pin assignments.   | Verify and correct net assignments to ensure each pin has a unique net. | Medium     |
| 4  | Low      | Style       | Circuit Description       | Inconsistent use of units (e.g., "µF" vs "uF").                        | Standardize to "µF" for microfarads throughout the document.          | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Completeness | Pinout Description Table, P1 | Missing notes for pin functions.                                       | Add brief descriptions for each pin function in the notes column.    | Medium     |

### Checks Performed

- Verified all refdes and nets against the allowed lists.
- Checked for missing component values and descriptions.
- Reviewed for typographical errors and unit inconsistencies.
- Ensured consistency between schematic and manual commentary.
- Confirmed the presence of all necessary tables and sections.
