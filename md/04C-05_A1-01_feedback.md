| #  | Severity | Category     | Location                                      | Finding                                                                 | Suggested Fix                                                      | Confidence |
|----|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | Major    | Consistency  | "Partlist (Schematic)"                        | Missing values for C1, C2, C3, C4.                                     | Specify values as per the manual commentary (0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF). | High       |
| 2  | Major    | Consistency  | "Manual Commentary"                           | C6 value discrepancy: 4.7 nF vs 4n7.                                   | Use consistent notation (4.7 nF) across all documents.            | High       |
| 3  | Major    | Net/Refdes   | "Netlist (Schematic)"                         | Duplicate entry for D1 on GND net.                                     | Remove duplicate entry.                                            | High       |
| 4  | Minor    | Typo         | "Manual Commentary"                           | Typo in "Protection/rectifier" section: "low-cap" should be "low-capacitance". | Correct to "low-capacitance".                                      | High       |
| 5  | Minor    | Units        | "Manual Commentary"                           | Use of "Ω" and "kΩ" is inconsistent with "ohm" and "kohm".             | Standardize to "Ω" and "kΩ".                                       | High       |
| 6  | Minor    | Consistency  | "Pinout Description Table, P1"                | Missing notes for all pins.                                            | Add notes or state "N/A" if not applicable.                        | Medium     |
