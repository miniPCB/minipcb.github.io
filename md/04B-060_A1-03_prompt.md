## Circuit Description

**Collector load (R4) & output coupling (C5):**

- **R4 1–10 kΩ** sets gain/current; **C5 1–10 µF** with output load sets LF corner.
    

**Emitter network (R5 to GND, R8/R9 network, C6 input coupling):**

- Input is at the emitter; pick **R5 47–470 Ω** (transimpedance); **C6** sized for desired **fc** with source impedance.
    
- Trade-offs: lower R5 gives higher current-gain but lowers input impedance.
    

**Base bias (R1, R2 pot, R3) + AC-ground caps (C3, C4):**

- Fix the base DC and hold it at AC ground with **C3/C4 0.1–1 µF**.
    
- Divider current ≈ 10× base current; **R’s 10–200 kΩ** typical.
    

**Supply decoupling (C1/C2):** as usual.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04B-060_A1-03_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
