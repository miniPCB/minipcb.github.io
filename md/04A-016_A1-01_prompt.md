## Circuit Description

**Diff network (R1–R4 main arms, R3 feedback to –IN, R5 output/load, R6/R7 bias bleeds):**

- Use precision pairs **4.99–49.9 kΩ (0.1%)**; start at **10 kΩ**.
    
- **R5 49.9–1 kΩ** depending on desired output impedance and cable drive (22–100 Ω if used purely as Rout).
    
- Trade-offs: absolute values set noise/current; matching sets CMRR.
    

**Output/comp (C5 from OUT to –IN/VN):**

- **10–47 pF** typical to tame peaking with long leads.
    

**Decoupling (C1–C4):** 0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF on each rail (±V).

**Op-amp:** dual-supply allows bipolar swing; pick Vos < 100 µV if you need accurate subtraction; GBP ≥ (gain × fmax × 10).

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04A-016_A1-01_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
