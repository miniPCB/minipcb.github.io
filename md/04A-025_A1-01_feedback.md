| 2  | Medium   | Consistency| Netlist          | `GND | C3 | + | + | 1` and `GND | C4 | + | + | 1` should be `-` for GND connection | Correct the polarity to `-` for GND connections                   | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency| Netlist          | `GND | Q1 | B | B | 1` is not a typical GND connection                                  | Verify if `B` should be connected to GND or correct the net       | Medium     |
| 4  | Medium   | Consistency| Partlist         | Missing values/descriptions for all components                         | Add values/descriptions for each component                        | High       |
