| 1  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | Net names `IN+`, `IN-`, `OUT`, `OUTPUT`, `UNUSED+`, `VFBUNUSED`, `VN`, `VP` are not allowed. | Replace with allowed net names: `GND`, `REF`, `V+`, `V-`.         | High       |
| 2  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | `OUTPUT` and `OUT` are used interchangeably.                           | Use a consistent net name, preferably `OUT`.                      | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Partlist   | Partlist Table   | Missing values/descriptions for all components.                        | Provide values/descriptions for C1-C5, R1-R7, P1, TP1-TP9, U1.    | High       |
| 4  | Medium   | Typo       | Manual Commentary| Typo: "comp" should be "compensation".                                 | Correct to "compensation".                                        | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Style      | Manual Commentary| Inconsistent use of units (e.g., "µF" vs "pF").                        | Standardize unit representation throughout the document.           | Medium     |
| 6  | Low      | Revision   | Revision History | Missing revision identifier for initial release.                       | Add a revision identifier (e.g., "A1-01") for the initial release. | Medium     |
