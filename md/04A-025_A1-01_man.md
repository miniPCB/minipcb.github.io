## Circuit Description

**Log element:**

- Channel A uses **D2 (silicon diode)** in the feedback; Channel B uses **Q1 (BJT)** junction in feedback.
    
- Temperature coefficient is **≈ −2 mV/°C** → consider thermal coupling or temp comp if precision matters.
    

**Input / feedback resistors (R1, R2):**

- Typical **1–100 kΩ** depending on current range.
    
- For diode-log: output ≈ **Vt·ln(Iin/Is)**; pick R so **Iin** spans the decade(s) of interest at your input voltage.
    
- Trade-offs: lower R increases dynamic range but raises source loading; higher R reduces current noise but increases Johnson noise.
    

**Supply decoupling (C1–C4):** as usual (0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF per rail).

**Op-amp:** low input bias current helps accuracy at small currents; low Vos matters less because the transfer is log-based, but recovery from overload and input protection do matter.
