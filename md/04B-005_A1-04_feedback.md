| 1  | High     | Refdes        | Netlist         | Refdes 'R9' appears with pads 'A' and 'S', which are non-standard.     | Verify and correct pad names to standard pin numbers or labels.               | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Refdes        | Netlist         | Refdes 'R2' uses non-standard pad names 'E' and 'A'.                    | Verify and correct pad names to standard pin numbers or labels.               | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Refdes        | Netlist         | Refdes 'R7' uses non-standard pad names 'A', 'S', and 'E'.              | Verify and correct pad names to standard pin numbers or labels.               | High       |
| 4  | Medium   | Net           | Netlist         | Net 'N$12' is missing from the allowed nets list.                       | Ensure all nets are listed in the allowed nets or correct the net name.       | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Typo          | Manual          | Typo in "Rsource ~~1 kΩ, Rin~~10 kΩ".                                   | Correct to "Rsource ~1 kΩ, Rin ~10 kΩ".                                       | High       |
| 6  | Low      | Missing Value | Partlist        | Missing values/descriptions for all components.                         | Add values/descriptions for each component in the part list.                  | Medium     |
| 7  | Low      | Style         | Manual          | Inconsistent use of symbols (e.g., '~' for approximation).              | Standardize the use of symbols for clarity and consistency.                   | Medium     |
| 8  | Low      | Documentation | Manual          | Lack of detailed explanation for test points (TP1-TP12).                | Provide a brief description of the purpose and use of each test point.        | Medium     |

### Checks Performed

- Verified all reference designators against the allowed list.
- Checked all nets against the allowed list.
- Reviewed for typographical errors and unit/style inconsistencies.
- Ensured all components have values/descriptions in the part list.
- Assessed the clarity and completeness of the manual commentary.
