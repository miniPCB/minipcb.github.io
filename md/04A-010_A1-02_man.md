## Circuit Description

**Gain network (R8 feedback high, R9 feedback low):**

- **Av = 1 + R8/R9**.
    
- Typical: **R9 1–10 kΩ**, **R8 4.7–100 kΩ** (Av ~2–21+).
    
- Lowering both reduces noise and raises input bias current error through R9.
    

**Bias/reference (R1–R7, C1, C3, C5):**

- Pot R2 (10–100 kΩ) + R1/R3 forms BIAS; **C1/C3 0.1–1 µF** to quiet it; **C5 1–10 µF** for VREF_FILTERED.
    
- Trade-offs: more filtering reduces output “bounce” when input is disconnected; but large caps slow settling when you adjust the pot.
    

**AC shaping (C7 from OUT to VFB, R10 series in VFB path, R11/R12 output loading):**

- Start with **C7 10–33 pF** for HF peaking control.
    
- Optional **Rout (R11) 22–100 Ω** helps with capacitive loads.
    

**Input path (R6 series, optional RC to ground R7/C5):**

- **R6 100–1 kΩ** helps with ESD and op-amp input protection diodes during overdrive.
    

**Supplies:** same decoupling practice as above.

**Op-amp:** unity-gain stable, GBP ≥ (Av × fmax × 10), rail-to-rail if single supply.
