## Circuit Description

**Gain network (R4 input, R5 feedback, R9 series/trim, R7 load):**

- Set gain: **Av = −R5/Rin**, where Rin is R4 (+ any series parts).
    
- Typical: **Rin 1–10 kΩ**, **R5 5–100 kΩ** (Av from −1 to −100).
    
- Lower values reduce Johnson noise and improve HF, but raise load on source and op-amp output.
    
- If you keep **R5 || Rload ≥ 2 kΩ**, many op-amps remain happy; add **Rout 22–51 Ω** if driving cables.
    

**Reference / bias (R1–R3, R6–R8, C1–C5):**

- Pot R2 (typically **10–100 kΩ**) builds a quiet mid-reference (VR/VREF+).
    
- Filter caps: **C1, C3, C4 = 100 nF–1 µF** local filters; **C2/C5 bulk 4.7–10 µF** to V+.
    
- Trade-offs: larger bias-node caps (1–10 µF) lower noise/offset drift on +IN, but slow start-up and recovery.
    

**AC shaping (C6 across VFB/OUT, C7 input coupling + J1):**

- **C7** with Rin sets input high-pass: pick **fc_in = 1–10 Hz** (e.g., Rin 10 kΩ + C7 1–10 µF).
    
- **C6** for stability/HF roll-off: start **10–47 pF** in parallel with **R5** (zero/pole with node impedances).
    
- Trade-offs: more C6 = better stability, lower noise peaking, but lower bandwidth.
    

**Supplies (C2, C5 bulk; C1, C3, C4 local):** values like 0.1 µF + 10 µF per rail as above.

**Op-amp U1:** GBP ≥ **|Av| × fmax × 10**; low Vos/Ib if you rely on a precision reference at +IN.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04A-005_A1-01_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
