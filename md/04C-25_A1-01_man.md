## Circuit Description

**Excitation/scale (R1 to V+, R2 to GND, R3–R6 around IN± and –IN):**

- Typical approach: force a known current through Rx or sense a divider.
    
- **R1, R8, R9 (REF path)** in the **10–100 kΩ** range to create a stable reference (exported on P1.6).
    
- **R3–R6** set transimpedance or gain: start **4.99–49.9 kΩ** precision.
    
- Trade-offs: higher R improves input loading but increases noise; precision (0.1% or better) improves measurement linearity.
    

**Output/load (R6 to OUT, R7–R9 REF network):**

- Keep **R6 1–10 kΩ** so the op-amp has a reasonable feedback impedance.
    
- Filter REF with **1–10 µF** if you need low noise; bleed with **100 kΩ** to fix DC points.
    

**Supplies (C1/C2):** 0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF.

**Op-amp:** low Vos/Ib are important for precision; if measuring to GΩ levels, consider a JFET/CMOS op-amp and guard rings on PCB.
