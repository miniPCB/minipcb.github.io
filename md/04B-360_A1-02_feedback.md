| 1  | High     | Completeness | Partlist           | Missing values/descriptions for all components (C1, C2, C3, C4, P1, Q1, Q5, R1-R9). | Provide specific values or descriptions for each component.          | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Consistency | Netlist            | Net names are consistent with allowed list, but ensure no additional nets are used. | Confirm no additional nets are used beyond the allowed list.         | High       |
| 3  | Low      | Typographical | Manual Commentary  | "V_emitter" should be "V_emitter" (consistent with other notations).   | Ensure consistent notation for emitter voltage.                      | Medium     |
| 4  | Medium   | Clarity     | Manual Commentary  | "PSRR" is used without definition.                                     | Define PSRR (Power Supply Rejection Ratio) in the document.          | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Style       | Supplies Section   | "0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF" lacks clarity on whether both are required or optional. | Clarify if both capacitors are required or if one is optional.       | Medium     |
| 6  | Medium   | Consistency | Pinout Description | Ensure pin labels match schematic and netlist (e.g., IN+, IN-, OUT+, OUT-). | Verify and ensure consistency across all sections.                   | High       |

### Checks Performed

- Verified component reference designators against allowed list.
- Checked net names for consistency with allowed list.
- Reviewed for missing component values and descriptions.
- Identified potential typographical errors and style inconsistencies.
- Ensured clarity and consistency in technical descriptions and terminology.
