# 04B-340 A1-03 — Feedback

The datasheet for the 04B-340 A1-03 Cascode Amplifier is generally well-structured, with clear sections for schematic export, part list, and manual commentary. However, there are several issues related to missing values, potential typos, and adherence to the allowed identifiers. Below is a detailed list of findings and suggested fixes.

| #  | Severity | Category   | Location          | Finding                                                                 | Suggested Fix                                                      | Confidence |
|----|----------|------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | High     | Completeness | Partlist (Schematic) | Missing values/descriptions for capacitors and resistors.               | Add specific values/descriptions for C1-C6 and R1-R10.            | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Consistency | Manual Commentary  | "CMS" likely intended to be "CMOS".                                     | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS" if applicable.                            | Medium     |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency | Netlist (Schematic) | Use of "-" for pads/pins in capacitors (C2-C6) is inconsistent.         | Specify actual pad/pin numbers or clarify if not applicable.      | High       |
| 4  | Low      | Style       | Manual Commentary  | Inconsistent use of bold for component references (e.g., **R2**).       | Standardize formatting for component references.                  | Medium     |
| 5  | Medium   | Accuracy    | Circuit Description | "R2 (pot 10–100 kΩ)" lacks clarity on whether it's a variable resistor. | Clarify if R2 is a potentiometer or fixed resistor.               | High       |
| 6  | Low      | Completeness | Pinout Description | Missing notes for P1 pins.                                              | Add notes or confirm if intentionally left blank.                 | Medium     |
| 7  | Medium   | Consistency | Netlist (Schematic) | Use of "NC" in Pinout Description Table for P1 is not explained.        | Define "NC" as "No Connection" in the notes.                      | High       |

### Checks Performed

- Verified all refdes and nets against allowed lists.
- Checked for missing component values and descriptions.
- Reviewed for typographical errors and unit/style inconsistencies.
- Ensured consistency in formatting and terminology.
- Confirmed completeness of pinout descriptions and notes.
