## Circuit Description

This file includes actual values, so you can see intent clearly:

- **Protection/rectifier:** **D1 = BAV99** (fast, low-cap), clamps the transducer input.
    
- **Input series R:** **R1 = 110 Ω** (damping / source Z trim).
    
- **Two feedback/input arms:** **R2 = 240 Ω**, **R3 = 240 Ω** define gain around the first op-amp;
    
- **Output/load shaping:** **R4 = 50 Ω** (line/cable matching), **R5 = 27 Ω** (output damping).
    
- **Bias / reference resistors:** **R6 = 10 kΩ**, **R7 = 10 kΩ** set node biases.
    
- **Compensation cap:** **C5 = 10 pF** (stability / zero).
    
- **Coupling/storage:** **C6 = 4.7 nF** between protection and the next stage for pulse shaping.
    
- **Decoupling (C1–C4):** populate as **0.1 µF + 4.7–10 µF** per rail.
    

**Trade-offs & considerations:**

- **Bandwidth vs noise:** small feedback values (hundreds of Ω) give low noise and wide bandwidth for 100 kHz–several-MHz ultrasound; they increase op-amp output current demand.
    
- **R4 = 50 Ω** is a good match to coax/cables; adjust between **33–75 Ω** based on cable and desired damping.
    
- **C5 (10 pF)**: raise to **22–47 pF** if you see peaking/ringing; lower it for more HF.
    
- **Clamp (BAV99):** fast and low capacitance; if you need even lower Cj, consider RF diodes at the cost of higher leakage.
