## Circuit Description

**Lower CE device Q1 + upper CB device Q2:**

- Set **Q1 Ic 0.5–2 mA** using **R5/R6/R7 networks**; **R7 (collector load) 2.2–10 kΩ** typical.
    
- **R2 (pot 10–100 kΩ)** + R1/R3 define bias and the cascode base/emitter potentials.
    

**Inter-stage/cascode node capacitors (C4/C5/C6 small to tens of nF):**

- Provide HF stability and supply isolation; start **10–100 nF**.
    

**Input coupling (C1) and output network (R9/R10, C6):**

- **C1 2.2–10 µF** for audio/LF; smaller for RF/ultrasonic.
    
- **R9 100–1 kΩ** as an output shaper/stopper; **R10 1–10 kΩ** to V+ completes the load network.
    

**Trade-offs:** cascode increases bandwidth and reduces Miller effect at the cost of headroom; ensure VCE of Q1 is kept roughly constant (use divider values to fix Q2 base).

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04B-340_A1-03_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
