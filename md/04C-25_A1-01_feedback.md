|----|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | Major    | Consistency  | "Manual Commentary" - "JFET/CMS op-amp"       | Typo: "CMS" should be "CMOS".                                          | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS".                                           | High       |
| 2  | Major    | Net/Refdes   | "Netlist (Schematic)"                         | Net "N$11" is not in the allowed list.                                 | Verify and correct the net name or update the allowed list.        | High       |
| 3  | Major    | Units        | "Supplies (C1/C2)"                            | Missing unit for capacitors C1 and C2.                                 | Specify the capacitance values for C1 and C2.                      | High       |
| 4  | Major    | Traceability | "Partlist (Schematic)"                        | Missing values/descriptions for several components (e.g., C1, C2).     | Provide values/descriptions for all components.                    | High       |
| 5  | Minor    | Consistency  | "Circuit Description" - "R1, R8, R9 (REF path)" | R8 is not mentioned in the schematic export.                           | Verify R8's role and update the schematic or description.          | Medium     |
| 6  | Minor    | Consistency  | "Netlist (Schematic)"                         | Multiple connections to "+IN" and "-IN" on U1 without clear distinction. | Clarify connections or update schematic for clarity.               | Medium     |
| 7  | Nit      | Typo         | "Manual Commentary" - "Excitation/scale"      | Typo: "Rx" should be "R_x" for consistency with standard notation.     | Use "R_x" instead of "Rx".                                         | High       |
| 8  | Nit      | Table Format | "Pinout Description Table, P1"                | Inconsistent use of capitalization in notes.                           | Standardize capitalization in notes.                               | High       |

### Checks Performed
