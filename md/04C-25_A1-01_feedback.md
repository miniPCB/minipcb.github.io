| 1  | High     | Refdes     | Netlist, Partlist       | Missing values/descriptions for C1 and C2.                             | Add values/descriptions for C1 and C2 in the Partlist.                 | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Net        | Netlist                 | Net "N$10" appears multiple times with different connections.          | Verify and correct the connections for net "N$10".                     | Medium     |
| 3  | Medium   | Typo       | Manual Commentary       | "CMS" should be "CMOS" in the op-amp description.                      | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS".                                               | High       |
| 4  | Low      | Style      | Manual Commentary       | Inconsistent use of µF and uF for capacitance values.                  | Standardize to "µF" for all capacitance values.                        | High       |
| 5  | Medium   | Refdes     | Netlist                 | Refdes "U1" is described as "Integrated circuit / Opto".               | Clarify if U1 is an op-amp or opto-isolator and update description.    | Medium     |
| 6  | Medium   | Net        | Netlist                 | Net "N$9" appears with multiple connections to U1.                     | Verify and correct the connections for net "N$9".                      | Medium     |
| 7  | Medium   | Refdes     | Manual Commentary       | R8 is mentioned in the REF path but not described in the Partlist.     | Add a description for R8 in the Partlist.                              | Medium     |
| 8  | Low      | Style      | Manual Commentary       | Inconsistent formatting of resistor values (e.g., "4.99–49.9 kΩ").     | Use consistent formatting for resistor values, such as "4.99 kΩ to 49.9 kΩ". | High       |

### Checks Performed

- Verified all refdes against the allowed list.
- Checked all net names against the allowed list.
- Reviewed for typographical errors and unit/style inconsistencies.
- Cross-referenced schematic and manual commentary for consistency.
- Ensured all components have descriptions and values where applicable.
