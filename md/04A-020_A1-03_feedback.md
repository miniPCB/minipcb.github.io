| 1  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | Net "BIAS" is not in the allowed list of nets.                         | Verify if "BIAS" is correct or replace with an allowed net name.  | High       |
| 2  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | Net "OUT" is not in the allowed list of nets.                          | Verify if "OUT" is correct or replace with an allowed net name.   | High       |
| 3  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | Net "POT.1" is not in the allowed list of nets.                        | Verify if "POT.1" is correct or replace with an allowed net name. | High       |
| 4  | High     | Netlist    | Netlist Table    | Net "POT.3" is not in the allowed list of nets.                        | Verify if "POT.3" is correct or replace with an allowed net name. | High       |

| 6  | Medium   | Partlist   | Partlist Table   | Missing values/descriptions for all capacitors and resistors.          | Add values/descriptions for each component.                       | Medium     |
| 7  | Medium   | Pinout     | Pinout Table, P1 | Pin 3 is missing a label.                                              | Add a label or note for Pin 3.                                    | Medium     |
| 8  | Low      | Typo       | Circuit Desc.    | Typo in "Ib*R errors" should be "I_b * R errors".                      | Correct to "I_b * R errors".                                      | High       |
| 9  | Low      | Style      | Circuit Desc.    | Inconsistent use of µF and uF.                                         | Standardize to "µF" throughout the document.                      | High       |
