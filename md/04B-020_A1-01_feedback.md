Below is a detailed list of findings and suggested fixes.

| #  | Severity | Category   | Location                  | Finding                                                                 | Suggested Fix                                                      | Confidence |
|----|----------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | High     | Consistency| Manual Commentary         | References to D1 and D2 in the bias string, which are not in the schematic. | Remove D1 and D2 references or add them to the schematic if needed. | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Completeness| Partlist (Schematic)      | Missing values/descriptions for capacitors and resistors.               | Add values/descriptions for C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, R1, R2, R3, R4.   | High       |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency| Manual Commentary         | "CMS" likely intended to be "CMOS".                                    | Correct "CMS" to "CMOS".                                          | High       |
| 4  | Low      | Style      | Netlist (Schematic)       | Inconsistent use of pin labels (e.g., "GND (1)" vs "1").                | Standardize pin label format throughout the document.              | Medium     |
| 5  | Medium   | Accuracy   | Pinout Description Table, P1 | Missing label for Pin 3.                                               | Add label or note for Pin 3 if applicable.                        | High       |
| 6  | Low      | Clarity    | Circuit Description       | Ambiguous description of "snubber" components.                          | Specify component values or provide a reference for snubber design. | Medium     |
| 7  | Medium   | Consistency| Netlist (Schematic)       | Inconsistent net naming (e.g., "OUTPUT (5)" vs "5").                    | Use consistent naming conventions for all nets.                    | High       |

### Checks Performed

- Verified consistency between schematic and manual commentary.
- Checked for unauthorized refdes and nets.
- Reviewed for typographical errors and unit/style issues.
- Ensured completeness of component descriptions and values.
- Assessed clarity and accuracy of technical descriptions.
