## Circuit Description

**Target currents & loads:**

- Pick **Ic 0.5–2 mA** for small-signal BJTs on 5–12 V rails.
    
- **Collector resistor R4 ~ (V+ − VCE(sat) − Vout_mid)/Ic** → typically **2.2–10 kΩ**.
    
- **Emitter resistor R5 100–1 kΩ** sets gain via degeneration; bypass part/all with **C4/C6** to increase AC gain.
    

**Bias divider (R1, R3 or R2 pot + R3):**

- Base at ~ **~(0.2–0.5)·V+**; divider current ≈ **10×** base current to reduce sensitivity → **R1||R3 ≈ 10×(β·Ic/V+)**; practical values **10–200 kΩ**.
    
- Pot **R2 10–100 kΩ** if you want trim.
    

**Coupling caps (C2 in, C6 out):**

- Choose **fc_in, fc_out 5–20 Hz**: e.g., with **Rsource ~~1 kΩ, Rin~~10 kΩ → C2 4.7–10 µF**; with **Rload 10 kΩ → C6 4.7–10 µF**.
    
- Trade-offs: larger caps improve LF but increase size/leakage.
    

**HF stability (C5 small, C4 across collector/emitter networks):**

- **C5 10–100 pF** from base to ground or across Rb to roll off HF and prevent oscillation; **C4** can set a pole/zero in collector path.
    

**Jumpers (J1/J2):** select AC/DC coupling paths or loads; design values around your test options.

## TestBASE Test Item Template (for any required experimental verification)
Use/extend the following JSON object for individual test items (Plan → Report mapping). Provide at least one example filled-out test for each critical function or risk area you identify.

```json
{
  "test_name": "Short, human-friendly title (e.g., “Op-amp offset vs. temperature”).",
  "test_no": "Unique test ID (e.g., 001).",
  "last_test_no": "Related/previous test ID (if applicable).",
  "single_or_batch": "single capable or batch only",
  "purpose": "What question this test answers and why it matters.",
  "scope": "Boundaries and conditions: in-scope subsystems, environments, ranges.",
  "setup": "Equipment/fixtures, DUT configuration, calibration steps, references.",
  "procedure": "Numbered, step-by-step instructions with timings and checkpoints.",
  "measurement": "Exactly what to record (signal names, units, sample rate, instruments/channels).",
  "acceptancecriteria": "Quantitative pass/fail thresholds with formulas or limits (include tolerances).",
  "conclusion": "Result summary (Pass/Fail) and brief rationale; note anomalies or follow-ups."
}
```
## Output Requirements
- Produce **each deliverable** as a separate Markdown section in your response, prefixed with a level-1 heading containing the target filename in backticks. Example:

# `04B-005_A1-04_epsa_plan.md`
(...content...)

- Include **FULL tables** (no truncation). If a table is extremely large, split across multiple tables or provide an attached CSV/JSON in addition to the Markdown.
- Include a **TODO** list per deliverable for any data you need from CAD (e.g., exact stackup, trace widths, thermal limits).
## Safety & Practical Notes
- If the circuit interacts with power electronics or high voltages/currents, include a **Safety Considerations** subsection.
- If any datasheet-dependent parameter is required (e.g., SOA, temp coefficients), mention the parameter and where it would be sourced.
