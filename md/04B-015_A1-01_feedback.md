| 1  | High     | Part List  | Partlist (Schematic)      | Missing values/descriptions for capacitors, diodes, and resistors.     | Add specific values or descriptions for C1, C2, C3, C4, D1, D2, R1, R2, R3. | High       |
| 2  | Medium   | Netlist    | Netlist (Schematic)       | Pin 3 of P1 is not labeled.                                            | Label Pin 3 of P1 or confirm if it is intentionally left blank.   | Medium     |
| 3  | Medium   | Consistency| Manual Commentary         | Inconsistent use of units (e.g., "10–100 kΩ" vs. "10 kΩ").             | Standardize unit presentation (e.g., "10 kΩ to 100 kΩ").          | High       |
| 4  | Low      | Typo       | Manual Commentary         | Typo in "LF corner" should be "low-frequency corner".                  | Correct "LF corner" to "low-frequency corner".                    | High       |
| 5  | Low      | Style      | Manual Commentary         | Inconsistent use of symbols (e.g., "~1.2–1.4 V").                      | Use consistent spacing around symbols (e.g., "~1.2 – 1.4 V").     | Medium     |
| 6  | Medium   | Netlist    | Netlist (Schematic)       | Unclear if "-" in capacitor pads indicates unconnected or missing data.| Clarify the meaning of "-" in the netlist for capacitors.          | Medium     |
