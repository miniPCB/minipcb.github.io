        The Comparators Collection is a set of educational circuit boards designed to support first- and second-semester electronics courses focused on analog circuit design and comparator operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This collection includes eight foundational comparator configurations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Inverting Comparator with Hysteresis</li>
        <li>Non-Inverting Comparator with Hysteresis</li>
        <li>(Coming Soon) Window Comparator</li>
        <li>(Coming Soon) Voltage Level Detector</li>
        <li>(Coming Soon) Schmitt Trigger</li>
        <li>(Coming Soon) Zero-Crossing Detector</li>
      </ul>

        <p>
        Each circuit is implemented as a standalone <strong>miniPCB™</strong> with standardized layout, clear labeling, and accessible test points for easy integration into lab environments. These boards are ideal for reinforcing key learning outcomes such as threshold detection, hysteresis, signal conditioning, and analog-to-digital interfacing.
        </p>

        <p>
        Instructors can use the full set to guide students through progressive exploration—from basic comparator configurations to more advanced circuits with hysteresis, window detection, and zero-crossing detection—while observing real-world switching behavior, response times, and noise immunity.
        </p>
